## Installation

Place the .zip file into the *resourcefolder* in Minecraft. Depending on what Minecraft launcher you are using, this process may be different.

The **universal way** to get to this folder:
1. Open Minecraft
2. Click Options and go to Resource Packs
3. On the bottom, click "Open Pack Folder"

This will take you directly to where you need to save the resourcepack in order for it to work in-game.
    
## Documentation

[Documentation coming soon!](https://github.com/puppyraeluna/blurae-0.5/wiki)

Blu-Rae 0.5x is an updated version of my previous resource pack called [Blu-RAE](https://github.com/puppyraeluna/blu-rae). The differences between the two packs is that my previous pack is at 64px textures while this version will focus on the Vanilla 16px with a MAX of 32px for the textures. I hope this version improves the accessibility of my pack with smaller sizes for older computers and improved compatibility with various Minecraft Servers.

This resource pack is expected to be for Minecraft Java Edition version 1.19 to 1.20.1.
